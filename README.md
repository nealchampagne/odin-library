# Odin Library

## Description
This is my implementation of the Odin Library project from the Javascript Course as part of the Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript curriculum.

This implementation uses a modal to get user input, feeds that input into a new Book object, adds the object to the myLibrary array, then uses the myLibrary array of objects to draw a "bookshelf" display of book cards.

This was a very interesting project as it was the first time I took user input and used it to dynamically update the content of a webpage. This was also my first time using modals.
